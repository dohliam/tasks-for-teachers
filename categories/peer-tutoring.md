# Peer tutoring

## Description

**Peer tutoring** or **peer partner learning** tasks involve pairs of students learning together collaboratively, individually taking on the roles of either teacher or learner during the task.

In a peer tutoring task, students work with a partner and are assigned the role of either "teacher" / "helper" or "learner" / "student" / "doer". While the "learner" works through an assigned activity (e.g., finding information, answering questions, working with previously-learned material), the "teacher" assists them by providing feedback or other information to help them complete the task.

Generally, after performing the first activity (or group of activities), students will be asked to switch roles.

## Benefits

* Students have the opportunity to reflect on information they have learned before while helping their classmates learn.
* Encourages group collaboration, engagement, and interaction with peers.
* Allows students to "learn by teaching others".

## Adaptations

* Apart from switching roles after completing the activity, students can also switch partners to apply what they have learned in a different context.
