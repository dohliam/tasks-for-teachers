# Cloze procedure

## Description

A **cloze procedure** is a simple activity where students are presented with a passage in which key words (or random words, or a certain number of words according to a formula) have been removed from the text and replaced with blank lines. As students read, they fill in the blanks to demonstrate understanding and construct meaning from the text.
