## Description

In a **dictogloss** activity, the teacher reads a short text about a topic while students take notes individually. Then the class is divided into groups who work together to create a summary of the text based on their notes and their understanding of the material.

As a warm-up, the class will often have a discussion of the topic before being read the prepared text. After the activity, each group can be asked to present their summary to the rest of the class.

Dictogloss activities are often used in language teaching to help students practice correct grammar structures in the target language. However, the skills of summarizing key information and working collaboratively in groups are applicable to any subject area.
