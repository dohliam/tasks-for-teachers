# Information gap

## Description

An **information gap** or **opinion gap** involves giving two people (or groups) different sets of information, which they keep hidden from each other, and which they have to use to find out the information given to their partner.

> In a typical information/opinion gap activity each learner in a pair or group holds information which is partial, or different from that of their partner(s). The task involves conveying information/opinions not already known to the other participant(s). Such tasks may vary in linguistic control over the intended message (e.g. communicative drills, 'describe and draw', problem-solving) and type of exchange (one-way/two-way, optional/obligatory exchange). (Johnson & Johnson, 1998, p. 166)

Information gap activities require students to communicate with each other to solve a problem or complete a task. In these activities, individual students do not have all of the information needed to achieve the activity’s goal, which creates a “gap” that can only be overcome by speaking with other students to exchange information. The missing information required to complete the activity can be facts, opinions, or details related to textual, audio, or visual content.
