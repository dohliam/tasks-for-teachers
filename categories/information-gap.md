## Description

> In a typical information/opinion gap activity each learner in a pair or group holds information which is partial, or different from that of their partner(s). The task involves conveying information/opinions not already known to the other participant(s). Such tasks may vary in linguistic control over the intended message (e.g. communicative drills, 'describe and draw', problem-solving) and type of exchange (one-way/two-way, optional/obligatory exchange). (Johnson & Johnson, 1998, p. 166)
