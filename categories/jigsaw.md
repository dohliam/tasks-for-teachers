# Jigsaw

## Description

> **jigsaw principle** refers to a methodological procedure whereby subgroups of learners in a class are asked to read or listen to different information concerning a particular topic or situation. The full picture is then pieced together, like a jigsaw, when the groups combine in discussion to complete the task. (Johnson & Johnson, 1998, p. 178)

A _jigsaw_ is a type of task that involves dividing information about a topic into individual sections, with each student or group of students being given a different section. During the activity itself, students must bring their different pieces of information together to form a complete picture of the "puzzle" as a whole.

Because of its inherently cooperative nature, the jigsaw is often a good way to get groups of students to work together and engage with the material.

The unique feature of jigsaws is that each student is responsible for a different part of the whole topic, reading, or lesson material. This allows them to each "specialize" in a small part of the knowledge shared by the group.

> Jigsaw, Elliott Aronson: Each member of a group learns an essential part of a whole of a topic by working with a focus group and then helps the home group to combine the knowledge to complete the task." (Jolliffe, 2007, p. 48)

In its most basic form, each student or pair of students in a class might be responsible for reading a different paragraph or section of a book chapter or article, for example. During the group activity, they would then combine their specialized knowledge of the text with that of others in the group to get a more complete understanding.

In more extended versions (e.g. "two-level jigsaw"), students in a home group might all specialize in or discuss some aspect of the learning material, then each move to different groups to learn other material, and then finally return to the home group to report back and teach the new material to their fellow group members. Multi-level jigsaws can be quite elaborate and rich learning experiences for participants if designed and implemented correctly.

> Just as in a jigsaw puzzle, each piece -- each student's part -- is essential for the completion and full understanding of the final product. If each student's part is essential, then each student is essential. That is what makes the Jigsaw instructional strategy so effective. (Maudlin, 2002)

## Benefits

* Aids in developing teamwork, collaboration, and cooperative learning skills
* Students have a high level of personal responsibility over the material while learning
* May allow for deeper learning of material than would be possible if students had to learn all of the information on their own
* Findings and overall understanding can be compared with classmates when students return to their home group to report back

* [Two-level jigsaw](/activities/two-level-jigsaw.md)

## Adaptations

* Students in expert groups can prepare posters, mini-presentations, or other material to present to their home/initial groups.
* Students can be given their subtopics in advance to allow them to research them on their own before coming to class.
* Each home group can be asked to give a presentation to the class covering all of the topics they have learned.
* As a final step, each group could work together to create an outline or study guide organizing their knowledge of the subject matter as a whole.
