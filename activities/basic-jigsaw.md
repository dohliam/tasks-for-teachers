## Description

The **basic jigsaw** or **single-level jigsaw** is the simplest kind of [jigsaw learning task](/categories/jigsaw.md).

## Steps

1. Assign all students to an _initial_ or _home_ group (usually a small group of up to five students).
2. Give each student in the group a "study topic" or specific role that they are responsible for (it might help if these roles are numbered on the board or an assignment sheet).
3. Students move out of their initial groups into "expert" groups where everyone has the same study topic or role.
4. The members of each expert group work together to study / discuss / learn more about their topic (usually within a specific timeframe).
5. Students move back to their initial teams and take turns teaching their topic to other team members.
